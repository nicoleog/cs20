                <p > Car accidents are life-changing experiences. The crash 
                    itself is only the beginning of what can be an extremely 
                    long process of filing an insurance claim, determining fault, 
                    and most importantly, getting the closure one needs to move on 
                    with their life. Don't go through this alone.
                 </p>
                 <p > At Landers & Myers, we have been fighting for victims of 
                     car accidents since 1988. Insurance companies tend to try 
                     to minimize compensation, but we won’t accept anything less 
                     than what you deserve. Our attorneys have the resources to 
                     go to trial if that’s what’s necessary to secure full and 
                     fair compensation for you.
                  </p>
                  <p > As America’s leading personal injury law firm, you can 
                      trust us to get the best results in your case. We’ve 
                      recovered over $9 billion for our clients, and we may
                       be able to help you, too.
